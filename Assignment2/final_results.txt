I have generated a code which helps a user to select a strong password
using the API,this provided length and special key constraints
the password also need to contain uppercase lowercase, and numbers to ensure security
splicing was also used to ensure the password was not too long
the code will select a password till a valid answer was achieved.
 Generated Password: <.2n7(,2989&>,, user password :<function new_password at 0x1028ec900>
