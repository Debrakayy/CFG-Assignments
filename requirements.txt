Assesment 1

I completed my first assesment with CFG and added the files to the repository

the requirement.txt file is a file containing plain text, it is the simplest format for storing and sharing information.

A gitignore file is used to signal git on what files to ignore, these files are not staged,committed and will not show in the working diretory.

I have added screenshots to the branch as evidence.
