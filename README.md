## About Me

I am  a **Chemical Engineering graduate** with an interest in **Data Analytics** and **Cybersecurity**, over the years I have done different courses to gain new skills and get more job opportunities.

In 2023, I completed a Google course in **Cybersecurity** also it was a bit challenging to balance work with this course I was able to make a plan and organise my time appropriately so I don't get overwhelmed and at the end of the degree I got a certificate to show my completion.

I am also currently doing a work based apprenticeship in **Data Analytics** and did a MOOC in **IA & Security**, which further peaked my interest in tech.
