## About Me

I am  a **Chemical Engineering graduate** with an interest in **Data Analytics** and **Cybersecurity**, over the years I have done different courses to gain new skills and get more job opportunities.

In 2023, I completed a Google course in **Cybersecurity**, it was a bit challenging to balance work with this course as I had other commitments, but I was able to make a plan and organise my time appropriately so I don't get overwhelmed.I Completed this degree and got a certificate to show my completion.
